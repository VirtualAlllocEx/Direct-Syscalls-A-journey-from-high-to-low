The technique of direct system calls is no longer a new attack technique for Red Teamers today (April 2023). I myself have covered this topic several times (DeepSec Vienna 2020) and there are already a large number of well-written articles and useful code repositories on the Internet. Nevertheless, I would like to revisit the topic and look at various aspects related to direct system calls.
